> Sometime in the near future, the CEO of a large telecom provider is using a smartphone app to check on her organization’s seven strategic initiatives. Within a few taps, she knows the status of every project and what percentage of expected benefits each one has delivered. Project charters and key performance indicators are available in moments, as are each team member’s morale level and the overall buy-in of critical stakeholders.[1]
This application is designed to assist in **project management and task tracking** using the power of **AI-based progress detection**. If you are looking for a tool to manage your projects efficiently, this application is perfect for you. It offers a wide range of features such as task management, progress visualization, and the ability to predict project bottlenecks using AI.

## Key Features :sparkles: :sparkles:

- **AI Progress Detection: This feature automatically tracks the progress of your project based on completed tasks, time spent, and user inputs. The AI detects bottlenecks and potential delays, offering suggestions for smoother project execution.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Allows teams to collaborate seamlessly, with updates shared instantly across the team. Team members can also leave comments, attach files, and view task progress in real-time.
- **Relationships**:This feature lets you link tasks together to make them more like a project within a project, which increases organization and makes the project easier to understand for people who enter the project after a long time.
 - **Task Prioritization**: An AI-powered prioritization engine helps in organizing tasks by their importance, based on project deadlines and dependencies.
- **Autosave and save logs**: The auto-save feature will help in saving all the changes and comments in the task automatically and also provides a log of these changes where it records when this change occurred, who did this and what was changed which helps in knowing the purpose of the changes in the task.

### Instant sharing features

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|       Feature Name    |Description             |Where is the property located?                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Auto save|This feature saves changes made within the project, whether comments, uploaded files, or completed tasks, and they are updated and displayed immediately.|'Integrated within the application, no need to activate it'|
|Storage records|This feature shows every modification that happened from the creation of the project until its end and records the reaction of every change, when and what the change was, whether small or big.            |At the top right, click **Project Details**, then click Records.            |
|Direct communication          |You can communicate with people within the project by writing comments that only they can see, or attaching files within the task that only the people you specify can open.|When you create a task, click on the **three black dots** at the top right of the task. Then click **Attach** and specify if you want to attach a file or comment to the task. Then click on the **Private** button and specify the people allowed to open it, then click **Send**|

### ٌReport :page_with_curl:
Click on **File** at the top left, then **Report**. A window will open that looks like a Word application. You can write reports here and attach them to the assignment.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

- **Missed Deadlines**: The AI will automatically highlight at-risk tasks and suggest adjustments in the timeline or reallocation of resources to keep the project on track.

- **Incomplete Task Details**: Incomplete tasks can lead to confusion and delays. The system alerts users to missing details, allowing them to quickly resolve these gaps.

- **Underutilization of Features**: Many users don't explore the full potential of AI features, such as reporting and forecasting. You can familiarize yourself with these features by accessing the **Help** section under the **View** tab.

## Advanced Usage

If you want to automate parts of your project management system using custom code, go to the task, click on the **three dots**, and select **Code**. You can choose Python or another programming language from the top right dropdown and write scripts to further automate task assignments or status updates.
